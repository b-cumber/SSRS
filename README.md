SSRS Document

Rules: All games rules have been complied by category. Emphasis is on smaller, more specific sections (ex: PDB combat is in the PDB section not combat section).

Test Plan
====

The test plan outlines the procedure and guidelines for testing. Section 9.3: Integration Testing Pass/Fail Criteria identifies the Rule, how to test the rule and the expected outcome for success of this test.

Each class should have a separate unit test document, which should be added to the test plan. Use the template unit_test_template.tex, one for each class.
